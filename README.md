Features:
Extracts transcripts directly from YouTube videos via youtube-transcript-api,
Processes transcript text with chunking for better summarization,
Summarizes text using Hugging Face's DistilBART summarization model locally (no OpenAI API required),
Simple and interactive UI built with Streamlit for easy input and summary display,
Supports multi-language transcript extraction based on YouTube video captions.
